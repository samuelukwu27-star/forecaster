In the context of the forecasting-tools repository, a script like this
would likely be used for post-tournament analysis.

Its purpose could be:
- To download forecasts from a completed tournament.
- To compare a bot's performance against the community prediction.
- To calculate scoring metrics like Brier scores or peer scores.
- To generate charts and reports on a bot's calibration and accuracy.
